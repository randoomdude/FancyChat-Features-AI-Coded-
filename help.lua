-- Pixel-aware row counter that matches ImGui's TextWrapped behaviour.

-- utils.CalcRows estimates rows by dividing total text length by an
-- average character width - fast, but inaccurate for proportional
-- fonts because most letters are narrower than the 'H' used as the
-- divisor.  That mismatch caused the help-section child frames to
-- under- or over-shoot the actual rendered height by a couple of rows.
--
-- This version walks the text word by word, calling imgui.CalcTextSize
-- on the running line and committing it when adding the next word
-- would cross wrap_width.  Embedded '\n' characters force a line
-- break.  Single words wider than wrap_width still count as one row
-- (ImGui hard-breaks them, but the row count we want for sizing the
-- child frame is the number of *visual* rows it ends up occupying;
-- this matches what we observe on screen close enough).
